Life is full of twists, turns, and surprises. It never once crossed my mind that coding would be something that would interest me in the least...Let alone be a potential career path in my life. My earliest memory of coding before I even knew about what HTML or CSS were was when I had a Myspace. I remember back in the day when you could customize your homepage with different font, skins, music and even change the number of top friends you had. It was as simple as copying and pasting some CSS from a page and following the instructions on how to make your page the coolest. This was if you could get on that good dial up connection. Who remembers the pop up dial up image from AOL when your internet was re-connecting. But I digress.

I first got intrigued by coding when I started working at an advertising agency in NYC. I was working on the digital team and had to communicate with all the different departments including the programmatic team. I learned that the programmatic team used coding on a daily basis and that was what initially sparked my interest. 

This interest was deepened by a visit to my sister in SF where she worked at Linkedin. I was able to visit her company office and see the environment that Linkedin had created for it's employees. I started to code in my free time at work and out of work with resources such as [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/) & [codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn). I really enjoyed it and decided to do more research and found that there was also a [lack of female presence](https://www.themuse.com/advice/why-we-need-to-rethink-women-in-tech) in the tech industry and the benefits of working as a developer. During my research I learned about the myriad of [programming bootcamps](https://www.coursereport.com/) that were available in NYC and remotely. 

I decided to take the leap when I realized that I was spending more time coding in my free time than having any interest in my advertising job. I wanted out of advertising to explore a whole new career path and that is what led me here today.
