So it's been about 3 months since I started my journey with Flatiron school. My experience so far has been really good! I feel like I've come a long way and I've been able to do things that I never imagined myself doing. I want to give a shout out to Mariam, who has been so great along the process. She really listens to what I have to say and gives valuable feedback and makes the experience so much more enjoyable. 

There are good days and there are obviously bad days. It's just a matter of pushing through the bad days and knowing when to ask for help from the technical instructors or even from Dakota. I feel like I am in a better place and learning to code has helped me be more curious about the world. I have been dealing with a lot of changes recently in my life. I moved all the way to California from NY, leaving behind my family and friends. I am working in a brand new environment that doesn't seem like work but it is. All while, coding part time and navigating life by learning more about myself and what I want to pursue in the present and goals for my future. 

Like my last blog ilfe is unexpected. It's like an array of unknown variables. You just don't know what your going to get next until you create action like a loop to figure out what comes next. Life and code are so similar because there are so many paths and ways to make changes and so many new variables or methods that can be added to make life or the code more effecient. I feel very lucky in my life that I am able to pursue my passions and try new things without much holding me back. I want to continue to live in the present and appreciate all that I have in my life. I already believe that once the program is done I'll have better opportunities than the opportunities provided by my college degree. I'm excited to learn more and see what happens next.
