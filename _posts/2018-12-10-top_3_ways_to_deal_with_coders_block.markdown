I think everyone has experienced this in their life where they get stuck and can't seem to find a solution to a difficult problem. Whether it's coding or in everyday life...there are times when you just don't understand what the hell is going on and your brain seems to come to a screeching halt and produce absolutely nothing. This is probably the time to get away from your computer and pre-occupy your mind with other stimulus so that you can come back with a fresh mindset. Here are a few of my favorite suggestions. (I practiced all of these activities during the Music Library CLI...)

** Meditating **

I never thought I'd ever be one of those people that would get into meditating but after doing a bunch of research, I started taking the time out my day to give it a shot. I didn't think that it would actually make a difference in my life but it has and I feel that it has helped me progress understanding my own thoughts and emotions. The best part about is that meditating doesn't take up a lot of time. I try to meditate right before the point where frustration from a lab or lesson takes over. I usually use the [headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) app on my phone. Here is a link for some [scientific based benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation) on meditating if you're interested in learning more! 

**Exercise**

Whether it's going for a short walk or a quick gym sesh, working out is a great way to get your mind off of what you're working on. It's also a great way to get moving after sitting all day hunched over a computer trying to troubleshoot and debug your program. I recently have been into rock climbing and yoga which is similar to meditating where the goal is to focus on what is going on in the present. Why choose to focus on the past or the future when you can't control either one? It's easier to control what you can do for yourself now in the present. Also there are a ton of health benefits to just exercising need I say more. The hardest part is getting started (& if it's winter it's getting out of the house). 

**Surfing The Web Like A Pro On Your Phone**

This is another great activity to do when I get coder's block. Taking the time to physically step away from my computer and becoming one with the couch. Just be mindful of your time and set a timer so you don't get trapped in the deepest parts of the internet or social media pages. Here are some of my favorite videos to watch when I need a break. Don't get trapped in the vortex of the internet!

These are just a few things that have helped me get through some of the tougher labs and lessons. This is definitely not a definitive list since everyone is different! It's always a good idea though to step away for a little no matter what you are doing to help your Coders Block! Happy coding and holidays!
