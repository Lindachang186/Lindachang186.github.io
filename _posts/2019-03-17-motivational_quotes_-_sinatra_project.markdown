My sinatra project, manifested from my lack of motivation to get through lessons and the project during the project period. I was struggling for a while when the project was due because I was so caught up and tired from work. It was hard to get to my lessons and the project when I was so mentally and physically drained. So I decided to create my project around Motivational Quotes to help me get through lessons to create my lesson. 

So my project allows users to sign up with a username and a password but they can't use a username that already exists. Passwords are also encrypted so it is harder for someone to log in as someone else. Once logged in a user can create posts that will be shared to all users. Users will not be able to create empty posts. Other users will not be able to edit or delete these posts even if they try to change the url post in the inspect. This is a program that will inspire others to get inspiration to finish whatever passion project they are working on and are stuck!
